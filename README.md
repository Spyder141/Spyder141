- 👋 Hi, I’m @Spyder141
- 👀 I’m interested in Game design and development, html, C++ Python and honestly any coding format...I'm like a black hole for this stuff, I want to know everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and HTML again, I stopped so I'm just refreshing. I really enjoyed the side jobs I did for friends on it, so just want to get back to it. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Coding AI.
- 📫 How to reach me Email: lcsprsh@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: really?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was in the Army
